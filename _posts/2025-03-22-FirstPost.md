# Hello Universe!

Welcome to my documentation/blogging site where I log all my inexperienced exploits in setting up a homelab!

*But that's not all!*

I plan to use this as an all purpose blog on my daily life as well!

Here you can find plenty of off-topics like my journey into a working life as a Software Engineer in Singapore, my love for Bouldering, my re-entry to speed cubing, exercise plans and so, so, so much more!

But before we get started, an introduction is in place eh?

Hi! My name is Darren Seah, just your typical mid 20s Singaporean male who has just entered the working force half a year ago!

I have been an avid boulderer, having picked it up since August 2020. Thankfully have not had any major injuries since~ I've got SNCS L1 and L2 cert, so do HMU if you'd wanna climb!

My recent obsession is having my own homelab! This is also the main reason why I started this blog in the first place!
